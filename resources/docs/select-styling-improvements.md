## Usage

No changes are required in how select elements are used. The styling improvements are applied automatically to all select elements in the application.

For SearchableSelect, continue using it as before:

```vue
<SearchableSelect
  v-model="form.field_id"
  :options="optionsList"
  :label="'Select an option'"
  :placeholder="'Search options...'"
  :valueKey="'id'"
  :labelKey="'name'"
/>
```

For standard select elements:

```vue
<select v-model="form.field">
  <option value="" disabled selected>Select an option</option>
  <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
</select>
```

The styling will be automatically applied.
